# hlwm-dots
Config files for my herbstluftwm setup (partially finished)

### Notes:

Dunst config isn't really done, so notifications look kinda out of place

### Required apps/fonts:

- herbstluftwm
- polybar
- rofi
- picom (ibhagwan fork)
- dunst
- kitty
- feh
- jetbrainsmono
- nerd fonts
- font awesome 6

### Installation:

If you have all the required apps/fonts, just navigate to `~/.config` and clone this repository, then `cd` into `hlwm-dots` and run the `install.sh` script

Add the following in your shell config: `source $HOME/.config/herbstluftwm/scripts/add-scripts-to-path`
